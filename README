VMS-CMS version 0.03
====================

This modules provides access to the VMS Code Management System (CMS)
using its callable interface.  CMS is an optional layered product that is
separately licensed from VMS itself.  CMS is part of the DECset family of
products.

64-BIT CODE ISSUES

The CMS shared image on Alpha appears to use some 64-bit code.  This
module worked fine on Itanium but failed with errors signaled by the
STR$ routines on Alpha.

After some debugging I found that CMS was passing 64-bit descriptors
to the callback routines.  I added code to handle this and then found
it was also passing 64-bit pointers to time values.  These addresses
are not passed correctly with CMS V4.5 (they are sign extended to 64
bits) but this appears to be fixed with V4.6.

I made some changes to the argument handling so that these pointers
are received as unsigned ints, then moved to an unsigned 64-bit int
before passing them to sys$asctim() as the address of the time value.
As a result, times are properly returned from these callbacks.  This
kludge should work until CMS passes an address that uses 33 bits.

I have not yet noticed CMS passing a P2 space address to a string ID
but I suppose it could.  If that happens, a similar kludge will be
necessary for those pointers.
